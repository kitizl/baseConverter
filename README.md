# baseConverter

A python program that converts a number from any base from 2 to 36.

Usage:
      `python main.py [OPTION] [from] [to] [number]
      OPTION :
          -h      : displays the helptext
          -c      : converts the given number
          from    : origin base (except 0 and 1 and a maximum of 36)
          to      : to base (except 0 and 1 and a maximum of 36)
          number  : number in the origin base`

This program was an experiment in functional programming in python (and is also proably the first complete program I've made in a very long time).
